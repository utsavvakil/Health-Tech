# Assignment 3
In this assignment, we have analyzed data from an Apple watch. We investigated the daily activity (calories burned and walking distance) with respect to how much sleep the user received.
Our initial hypothesis was that there would be a positive correlation between the distance & calories burned and the hours of sleep the night of.

# Result
We found that the number of hours during the night of exercise was not consistent with our hypothesis, in fact, there was a weak negative correlation between exercise and hours of sleep the night of.
<br> Alternatively, we found that the amount of exercise and number of hours of sleep the night after were directly proportional.

# Insights
It appears that recovering from a day with more intense exercise requires more sleep the night after rather than the night of.
We believe some of the physiological aspects related to this have to do with muscle recovery that might not take place immediately
